 TheApp - PERN Stack Admin Panel  

TheApp is an admin panel built using the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich admin panel for managing application data and configurations.  

 Project Structure  

 Client  
The client side of the application is a React-based frontend built using modern UI libraries and tools for a sleek and intuitive interface.  

- Core Libraries:  
  - React: Modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
  - Material UI (MUI): For creating reusable and responsive UI components.  
  - Styled Components: For styling React components dynamically.  
  - Axios: For making HTTP requests to the server.  

- Features:  
  - Role-based access control.  
  - Interactive dashboards and tables.  
  - Authentication and authorization with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).  
  - Secure password management using bcrypt.  

- Dependencies:  
  Refer to the `package.json` in the client folder for the full list of dependencies.  

 Server  
The backend is an Express-based server designed to handle API requests, database operations, and authentication.  

- Core Libraries:  
  - Express: Lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs.  
  - PostgreSQL: Database for storing structured data.  
  - bcryptjs: For secure password hashing.  
  - JWT: For user authentication and session management.  

- Features:  
  - API routes for CRUD operations.  
  - Secure authentication and session handling.  
  - Middleware for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and environment configuration (dotenv).  

- Dependencies:  
  Refer to the `package.json` in the server folder for the full list of dependencies.  

 Installation  

 Prerequisites  
- Node.js installed on your system.  
- PostgreSQL setup with an accessible database.  

 Steps  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/theapp.git  
   cd theapp  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   - For the client:  
     ```bash  
     cd client  
     npm install  
     ```  
   - For the server:  
     ```bash  
     cd server  
     npm install  
     ```  

3. Configure environment variables:  
   - Create a `.env` file in both the `client` and `server` directories.  
   - Add necessary environment variables such as database credentials, JWT secret, etc.  

4. Run the application:  
   - Start the server:  
     ```bash  
     cd server
